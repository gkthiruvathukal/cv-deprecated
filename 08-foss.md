# Open-Source Software Releases

My entire list of projects is at http://thiruvathukal.com. Here are some highlights:

- High-Performance Java Platform Computing, <http://hpjpc.googlecode.com>. The PDF book has been downloaded 2,327 times (without even being announced). The Java examples have been downloaded 1,000 times; C# examples about 300 times. I have also been contacted by Michael Phillippsen in Germany to obtain the 0/1 Knapsack and other example codes for use in his High Performance Computing class. 
- Better XML, <http://betterxml.googlecode.com>. We have not done a public release of this software yet but the paper and presentation have been downloaded 120 and 223 times, respectively, again with no publicity. 
- Layered/versioned filesytems, http://olfs.googlecode.com. This is an active project with Kaylor, LÃ¤ufer, and Thiruvathukal that is scheduled for a first beta release this year. We expect this project to have very high impact. This project allows you to keep multiple versions (generations) of files without having to rename them, so it is easy to understand the benefits, even for a non-computing person!

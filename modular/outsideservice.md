# Service

## Peer Reviewing and Conference Committees

Program Committee, ICSoft 2009 and 2010
Program Committee, Cloud Computing 2010

## Panel Service

- I have served on multiple panels at the National Science Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities. In Summer 2010, I was asked to serve on three NSF panels but was only able to serve on two of them.
- I may have the distinction of being one of the few people at Loyola ever to serve on panels at both NEH and NSF, especially in the same year.

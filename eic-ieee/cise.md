This is my application for the position of Editor in Chief (EIC)
position at Computing in Science and Engineering (CISE) Magazine. 

I've been officially connected to CiSE since 2004 and unofficially
since 2002.

I wrote my first article, *Java at Middle Age: Enabling Java for
Computational Science* <http://ecommons.luc.edu/cs_facpubs/46/> for
CiSE in 2002 at the invitation of Paul Dubois, the longtime and
popular editor of the *Scientific Programming* department.  Not long
after appearing in CiSE, Paul Dubois asked me to serve as the
department editor. Being a person who knows the amount of work it
takes to produce good content, I initially hesitated, but officially
joined CiSE in 2004, where I served since 2009. I'd like to think that
my tenure as the department editor continued the excellent tradition
of quality that Paul was able to maintain over 20+ year period.

When Norman Chonacky became the Editor-in-Chief, he called upon me to
step into more strategic and leadership ro
In addition to the Scientific Programming department, which continues to
generate significant interest among readers, I have also been
influential in organizing special issues. I was the guest editor of a
special issue on Cluster Computing and have worked with Norman Chonacky
to get two exciting special issues organized by leaders in the exciting
areas of HPC Education and Reconfigurable Computing. These three
examples of special issues are truly representative of the type of
content I think is important to maintaining and growing interest in
CISE: (a) bringing state-of-the-art research to computational
scientists, and (b) reaching out to educators and other new communities.

In terms of what I would like to accomplish as EIC, these are just a
handful of ideas that come to mind:

expanding our online presence
  ~ Bill Feiereisen and I have drafted a document as part of an ad hoc
    task force to explore ways that CISE can best utilize the web. The
    three dimensions of getting online include following the online
    journal model (e. g. Science Online, <http://www.sciencemag.org/>,
    forming a computational science portal, and department blogs. I
    would like to see us begin putting this plan into place, subject to
    concurrence of the board.

broadening our impact, then our impact factor
  ~ My recent efforts with the HPC Education initiative at SC 2007
    <http://www.sc-education.org> have convinced me that our community
    in general has a long ways to go, especially when it comes to the
    various on-ramps to CISE education itself. We should invite to the
    board new board members from K-12, community colleges, and
    non-traditional institutions as part of a long-term strategy to
    broaden our impact. While not all of our content is ideally suited
    to undergraduate and secondary education, I am convinced that we
    must be doing whatever we can to reach these levels. I want as many
    people as possible to know of the CISE acronym first and foremost as
    CISE Magazine. (Most of my friends who do computer science research
    ask, “Is CISE part of NSF?”, because NSF has a CISE directorate.)

improving collaboration and communication within the board
  ~ Having been in attendance at all board meetings since becoming a
    department editor, I cannot help but notice that we are great at
    generating ideas but not able to act on them in a timely manner (if
    at all). Oddly enough, much of the business world has already found
    ways to deal with these sort of productivity problems using issue
    tracking systems and discussion forum software, among others. Much
    of this owes to our inability to collaborate beyond e-mail, which by
    its nature is not conducive to multicast (group) communication. I
    will work hard—possibly with the help of a new associate editor—to
    ensure a robust plan is in place to collect the various ideas and
    track progress with a finer degree of granularity than has been in
    place since I joined the board.

involvement of associate editors
  ~ The previous point highlights this need. In general, an EIC really
    cannot do everything, despite his/her best intentions. Having served
    as the chair of university councils (our Graduate Council, in
    particular) gave me the opportunity to learn firsthand the
    importance of delegation. Virtually all aspects of being the EIC can
    be delegated, save perhaps the ultimate judgment call of what is
    *fit to be printed or appropriate to the mission of CISE*. It is my
    intention to involve the associate editors in all aspects of the
    magazine, including the iterative planning and execution of the
    editorial calendar.

advertising not necessarily harmful
  ~ I still have a lot to learn about this particular issue but
    sometimes find myself perplexed as to how there can be zero
    advertising in CISE. While we are possibly too small to reach a
    meaningful market, our future online initiatives might well require
    us to rethink the role of advertising. There is a great value
    proposition in the *keywords* of CISE, and it strikes me that
    technologies similar to Google AdWords and AdSense could have
    significant potential to raise revenue for CISE online, given our
    relatively small circulation. At a minimum, Analytics software
    (created for online advertising) can help us to understand what
    topics truly interest our readers and have significant impact.

putting the engineering back in CISE...or remove it from our name
  ~ At SC ’06, I was sitting with Jeff Bebee at our booth and decided to
    do an experiment to learn something about the most frequent keywords
    that appear in all CISE articles within the past 5 years. I took the
    PDF versions of all articles, which Jeff distributes on a CD at
    various conferences (including SC), and imported them into a tool
    that builds an index of all non-noise words. My analysis revealed
    that the term *engineering* seldom appears in the articles we
    publish in CISE, while in contrast the term *science* does. This is
    either a manifestation of a possible problem or a sign that we might
    need to sharpen our focus.

international outreach
  ~ Computational science and engineering is practiced worldwide,
    especially as a result of worldwide activities arising from the
    Internet itself and (more specifically) grid computing. In addition,
    China and India in recent years have been graduating more computer
    scientists and engineers than any other countries in the world.
    Norman Chonacky has done a great job of expanding the composition of
    the board; however, there is a great need to expand beyond North
    America with at least one board member from every continent, save
    Antarctica. Given our likely budgetary situation, we will need to
    explore ways to involve more international members, especially if
    funding does not allow us to support their travel to annual
    meetings. (In other words, fostering collaboration and online
    presence will become all the more important, especially in the next
    few years, until we find other ways to fund our existence.)

reaching underrepresented and under-served groups
  ~ This is more of a personal item. I am a professor at a university
    with a 65% female population and a significant population of
    underrepresented groups. Yet even at my university, the trend for
    these groups enrolling in computer science (traditional or applied)
    and engineering-related subjects remains low. CISE need not be
    entirely about addressing the national problem but certainly could
    address these issues through special issues and/or a new department.
    I will work personally as EIC to ensure that CISE is among the
    leaders at promoting and encouraging diversity.

These are just a handful of ideas that come immediately to mind. I am
willing to work with the selection committee and editorial board to
address other items of interest and concern. So the above list is hardly
cast in stone. I welcome the opportunity to serve in this role and will
do whatever I can to leave CISE in an even better position than I found
it.

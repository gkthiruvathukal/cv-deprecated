General outline:

- Have served on CN editorial board as an AEIC for almost 4 years.

- Involved in blogging, special issues, technical leadership, labs efforts, and social/engagement strategy.


Why CN is valuable to the Computer Society:

- a center of thought leadership

- a place to evaluate emerging technolologies 

- added visibility to publications, especially lesser known ones

- 

What CN needs to reach the next level:

- Must be able to accept peer-reviewed content through Manuscript Central. We could join forces with the emerging transactions on stuff that is not covered by any other transactions.

- Must be able to support open access content, even if for a fee. Follow the AIP Advances model. This is one of our few perceptible hopes to monitize anything.

- Must get back to a more agile focus.

  - I like meetings but think we need to do less meeting and more working.

  - more EIC/AEIC/and board involvement in content generation. We seemingly need a department-like
  model from the magazines. Another possibility is that each magazine is a department. 

  - decouple from the magazine/transctions calendar and focus on timely publication whenever needed

  - great need for a hosted, external CMS. This would either be FOSS or a commercial provider that
    specializes in lightweight CMS technology that integrates with enterprise infrastructure



- Must have support for short-term memberships (day/week/month passes) and instant sign-up for students.

- EIC must have budget. Without a budget, CN will always be considered to be interesting but not
  important to the publications. A graduated tax model should be adopted to support CN for an interim
  period until the monetizing strategy can take hold. Monetizing cannot be left to SEO and other
  methods, which might already be part of a disappearing act. Monetizing can happen by also taxing
  any new memberships that come by way of the CN quick sign up page. I'd like to see several options
  available uniquely on CN:

  - join the society for a day 

  - contribute to the society?

  -
